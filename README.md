# The Maze Runner

## Specifications

This program explores a maze, finding a path from an entry point to an exit one.

- The maze is stored in a text file, with `#` representing walls and `␣` (_empty space_) representing passages.
- You’ll find examples of such mazes in the [`examples`](./examples) directory. 
- The Maze is surrounded by walls on its four borders, except for its entry/exit points.
    - Entry and exit points are always located on the East and West border.
- At the beginning of the exploration, we're located on the entry tile, facing the opposite side.
- The program generates a sequence of instructions to reach the opposite exit (i.e., a "path"):
    - `F` means 'move forward' according to your current direction
    - `R` means 'turn right' (does not move, just change direction), and `L` means ‘turn left’. 
- The program takes as input a maze and print the path on the standard output.
- The program can take a path as input and verify if it's a legit one.

## How to run this software?

To build the program, simply package it with Maven:

```
mosser@azrael A1-Template % mvn -q clean package 
```

#### Command line arguments

The delivered program at the end of this assignment should use the following flags:

- `-i MAZE_FILE`: specifies the filename to be used;
- `-p PATH_SEQUENCE`: activates the path verification mode to validate that PATH_SEQUENCE is correct for the maze
- `-method {tremaux, righthand}`: specifies which path computation method to use. (default is right hand)
